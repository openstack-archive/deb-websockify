Description: Removes include/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf from setup.py
 Websockify is +dfsg because include/web-socket-js/WebSocketMain.swf isn't
 built from source. So we also need to remove the WebSocketMain.swf file from
 setup.py to avoid failure (eg: this file isn't there anymore in the dfsg
 version of websockify).
